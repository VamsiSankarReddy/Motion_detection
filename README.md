Motion_Detection_using_python
This repository contains a Python-based motion detection system that detects and tracks moving objects using OpenCV. The project captures video frames, processes them to identify motion, and highlights detected movements.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview -> Uses OpenCV to process video streams. -> Implements background subtraction and frame differencing for motion detection. -> Draws bounding boxes around moving objects. -> Supports real-time motion tracking using a webcam or pre-recorded videos.

ðŸš€ Features -> Real-time motion detection with OpenCV. -> Frame differencing & contour detection for identifying motion. -> Customizable sensitivity thresholds for accurate detection. -> Save detected motion frames for further analysis.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used -> Python -> OpenCV (cv2) -> Numpy
